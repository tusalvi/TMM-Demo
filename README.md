# Clickstream Data Analytics with Confluent ksqlDB and Kafka Connect

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time clickstream data analytics pipeline using Confluent's ksqlDB, Kafka Connect, Elasticsearch, and Grafana. It showcases the process of collecting, processing, and visualizing user interaction data from a website to gain insights into user behavior.

## Overview

The clickstream analytics pipeline involves the following components:

1. **Data Collection**: Simulated clickstream events are generated to mimic user interactions on a website.
2. **Stream Processing with ksqlDB**: ksqlDB processes the incoming clickstream data to compute key metrics such as page views, user sessions, and error rates.
3. **Data Storage with Elasticsearch**: Processed data is stored in Elasticsearch to enable efficient querying and analysis.
4. **Visualization with Grafana**: Grafana is used to create dashboards that visualize the analytics derived from the clickstream data.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: Version 1.11 or later.
- **Docker Compose**: Included with Docker for Mac by default.
- **Allocated Memory for Docker**: At least 6 GB.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [Clickstream Data Analysis Pipeline tutorial](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/ksqldb/tutorials/clickstream.html).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:confluentinc/examples.git confluentinc-examples
   ```


2. **Navigate to the Clickstream Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd confluentinc-examples/clickstream
   ```


3. **Checkout the Latest Version**:

   ```bash
   git checkout latest
   ```


4. **Start the Docker Containers**:

   Use Docker Compose to start the required services, including Kafka, ksqlDB, Elasticsearch, and Grafana.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```


5. **Access the ksqlDB CLI**:

   After the services are up and running, access the ksqlDB CLI to interact with the stream processing application.

   ```bash
   docker exec -it ksqldb-cli ksql http://ksqldb-server:8088
   ```


6. **Run ksqlDB Statements**:

   Execute the ksqlDB statements provided in the `statements.sql` file to create streams and tables for processing the clickstream data.

   ```sql
   RUN SCRIPT '/path/to/statements.sql';
   ```


7. **View Dashboards in Grafana**:

   Once the data is being processed and stored in Elasticsearch, access Grafana to visualize the analytics through pre-configured dashboards.

   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to access Grafana.

## Key Features
